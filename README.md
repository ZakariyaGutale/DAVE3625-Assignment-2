# DAVE3625 Assignment-2: Predicting TESLA's Stock Price
We've made a tool that guesses TESLA's stock price based on past prices.

# How the Tool Works:
We use a file called TSLA.csv that has old stock prices.
We take the dates from this file and change them to numbers, so our tool can understand them better.
We split our data: some for teaching the tool and some for testing it.
After teaching our tool with the training data, we test how well it learned using the test data.
# Why Did We Use Linear Regression?
Task Nature: We're trying to guess a number (stock price), so Linear Regression is a good choice.
Simple and Clear: It's a basic tool that's easy to understand and use.
Tracks Trends: Stocks usually go up or down over time, and this tool can see those patterns.
# How Do We Know It's Working?
Mean Squared Error (MSE): It's like a score. A lower number is better and means our guesses are close to the real prices.
R^2 Score: It's another score. A score close to 1 means our tool is doing a great job.
